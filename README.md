# This is a sample React application to experiment with React hooks

This project helps with:

1. Best tooling for a React application
2. Using both functional and Class components in a project
3. Using very basic Reach router instead of traditional React router
4. Using Parcel instead of Webpack
5. Work with babel and parcel in same project
6. How to use context API with hooks and class
7. Usage of Portals

To run the app in mock mode, run: npm run dev:mock

To run with actual API's, run: npm run dev
